SEGA, also known as SEGA Corporation, is a multinational video game developer, publisher, and hardware manufacturer based in Japan. The company was founded on June 3, 1960, and has since become one of the most recognizable and influential names in the gaming industry.

SEGA initially started as a manufacturer and distributor of arcade games, producing popular titles such as "Space Invaders" and "Out Run." In the 1980s and 1990s, SEGA expanded into the home console market with the release of consoles like the SEGA Master System and the iconic SEGA Genesis (known as the Mega Drive outside North America). The SEGA Genesis/Mega Drive competed with Nintendo's Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) during the console wars of that era.

SEGA is widely known for creating iconic video game franchises, including:

1. Sonic the Hedgehog: The flagship franchise of SEGA, featuring the fast-paced adventures of the blue hedgehog Sonic and his friends.

2. Yakuza: A critically acclaimed series of action-adventure games set in the Japanese criminal underworld.

3. Total War: A popular strategy game series that combines turn-based gameplay with real-time battles, focusing on historical warfare.

4. Persona: A highly regarded role-playing game (RPG) series known for its compelling stories, memorable characters, and stylish visuals.

SEGA has also collaborated with other developers and publishers, both in Japan and internationally, to bring a diverse range of games to its platforms.

In addition to game development and publishing, SEGA has expanded its business to include arcade machine manufacturing, mobile game development, merchandise licensing, and digital distribution platforms like the SEGA Store and SEGA Mega Drive Mini.

In terms of professional experience, I have worked as a Senior Software Engineer at Tencent Music Entertainment (TME) in Shenzhen, China. In this role, I designed and developed the infrastructure for the QQ Music recommendation system, including recommendation engines, content tagging outreach, and other related services.
